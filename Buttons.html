<!-- This html file consists on what buttons are and how to style them using CSS (Cascading Style Sheet)
A button is written in html using <button></button> attribute.
We can create multiple buttons and add various attributes to them in HTML.
-->

<body>
<style>
    .subscribe_button{
        background-color: rgb(200, 0, 0);
        color: honeydew;
        border: none;
        height: 36px;
        width: 105px;
        border-radius: 3px;
        cursor: pointer;
        font-size: medium;
        margin-right: 8px;
    }

    .join_button{
        background-color: white;
        color: rgb(32, 144, 189);
        height: 36px;
        width: 70px;
        border-radius: 3px;
        cursor: pointer;
        border-color: cornflowerblue;
        font-size: medium;
        margin-right: 8px;
    }

    .tweet_button{
        background-color: rgb(0, 136, 255);
        border: none;
        height: 36px;
        width: 70px;
        border-radius: 18px;
        color: white;
        font-size: 15px;
        cursor: pointer;
        font-weight: bold;
    }

</style>
<button class="subscribe_button">
    SUBSCRIBE
</button>
<button class="join_button">
    JOIN
</button>
<button class="tweet_button">
    Tweet
</button>
</body>


<!--

1.In the above html code, we have buttons defined called SUBSCRIBE, JOIN and Tweet.Each of these buttons have attributes called "class", which acts as a unique identifier to style them using CSS.

2.We can link a button in css using .(followed by class value). For example:
  <button class="subscribe_button"> => the value of attribute class is "subscribe_button", so we need to add this in this manner in the <style> tag to style 
  all the buttons that have "subscribe_button" as their unique class identifier.
    .subscribe_button{
       ///style here///
    }
NOTE : We can write css code to modify the appearance of other elements.Written inside the <style> tag

3. button{ } is a css-selector, this tells which elements of html are going to be styled.
button{
    background-color: red;
}
background-color here is called css property
red is called css value

4. Attributes : 
-> if you wish to remove a property you can set it to none, here I wanted to remove the border so I set {border: none}   (CHECK LINE 34)
-> height: 40px; px = pixels
-> color => if rgb (255,255,255) then white ; rgb(0,0,0) then black
-> round your button borders => border-radius
-> in order to create a hand-pointer we change cursor attribute to pointer
-> In order to target a specific button we add a new attribute to button
called class => <button class="">
    this can be used in css by .(give button class value here)
    ie .subscribe_button{
        ....
        ....
    }
-> In order to add space between 2 things we use "margin"
-> In order to set font as bold we use font-weight
