<!--
Html identifie the elements that are being added into the web-page into Block elements or Inline elements
BLOCK ELEMENTS :
-> they take up the complete line (stretch of the webpage from left to right)
-> also adds a new space the moment you create a new block element
-> Example : adding a <p> element or <div> element creates a new block/space for itself. These block elements can internally have inline elements.

INLINE ELEMENTS:
-> It takes up only the width of the page to which it is assigned. They can be added within the block elements.
If we wish to highlight specific data within a parapgraph or h1 tag for example we can add these
like <span> element, <em> - emphasis element, <strong> element
-->

Giving you a <em>list of all the pages</em> I am adding for the eccommerce website...
</p>

<!--
Here <em> is an emphasis element which tells the website to emphasise or consider it as important. So web turns the element into italics to stand out from
the rest of the paragraph. Similarly we have multiple elements like :
<span> element - data can be formatted
<em> - emphasis element - makes it italic
<strong> element - makes it bold and increases font size.
