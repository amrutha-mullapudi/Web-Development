-->

<!--- This declares that html is a document type declaration
What does that mean?
Well, The HTML document type declaration, also known as DOCTYPE, is the first line of code required in every HTML or XHTML document. The DOCTYPE declaration is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in. This ensures that the web page is parsed the same way by different web browsers
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>

<!--- lang attribute gives the language of the html which is english here -->
<html lang="en">

<!--- What is a head? What does it contain?
A HEAD TAG IS A CONTAINER OF META DATA (WHICH MEANS DATA ABOUT DATA)
1. META TAG
-> everything inside head element is not shown in the webpage we can add author details, description in the metadata tag.
-> All of the above information would be pickedup by a search engine or web search which wants to learn more about our web page.
-> this tag can have name and its respective content like name of the author of the webpage and the description of what this webpage contains
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. TITLE 
->The <title> tag defines the title of the document. The title must be text-only, and it is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab.
-> It can also have an image beside the title bar with name, which we call as a favicon (fav-icon).
->  To add a favicon to your website, either save your favicon image to the root directory of your webserver, or create a folder in the root directory called images, 
    and save your favicon image in this folder.
3. BREAKING THE LINK TAG  -   <link rel="" href="" type="">
-> link element has rel attribute which is relate (means how does this attribute relate to the head of the web-page)
        <link rel="icon"> (means its of the type icon)
        <href = "example.png"> </href>  (hyper-text reference, where you give path of the image)
        <type = "image/x-icon"> </type>  (the type of image we are passing here)
-> Similarly you can link a css file with styling and add it into the link tag with rel="stylesheet" ; type="text/css"
